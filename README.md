# Undergraduate-Projects
Each project I've undertaken has been stored in the folder named by that specific project.

# 1) Generalized AI (General code for different environments!)
      This folder contains the first two stages of my undergraduate project.
            # a) The first stage is stored in the folder named DeepQLearning.
                        This folder contains the model.py file and the main.py file. The model.py file contains the code of the DeepQLearning algorithm implemented using the PyTorch python package.
                        The main.py is the instantiation of DeepQ model. Running this file produces the tmp folders containing the run for each iteration. The tmp500 file contains 500 video files representing the agent playing in the SpaceInvaders Environment. We can see that the agent improves over time as the score for each iteration on average increases. 

# 2) MATLAB Implementation of Neural Networks
